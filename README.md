# Introduction to HashiCorp Terraform

[HashiCorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is a powerful open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that enables organizations to efficiently manage and provision their infrastructure in a **declarative** and **version-controlled** manner. With Terraform, you can define your infrastructure's configuration as code, making it easier to collaborate, automate, and scale your infrastructure deployments.

Terraform uses a simple, human-readable language to describe the desired state of your infrastructure, and it can manage resources across various cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more. By using Terraform, you can avoid manual and error-prone infrastructure provisioning processes and gain greater visibility and control over your IT resources.

This introductory course will explore the key concepts, benefits, and fundamental principles of Terraform. You'll have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience by working with Terraform to provision and manage infrastructure resources using [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-azure/), one of the leading cloud platforms in the industry. This practical approach will not only equip you with Terraform skills but also provide you with valuable experience using it within a real-world cloud environment.

Whether you're a developer, system admin, or DevOps engineer, Terraform can simplify your infrastructure management and deployment workflows, making it an invaluable tool in the world of modern cloud computing and infrastructure provisioning.

Additionally, this course prepares you for the [Terraform Associate 003 certification](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate), enabling you to validate your expertise in Terraform and enhance your career prospects.
