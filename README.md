# Prerequisites

This course prepares you for the [Terraform Associate 003 certification](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate), enabling you to validate your expertise in Terraform and enhance your career prospects.

To gain full advantage of this course, basic knowledge of and access to Azure is recommended. In addition, you should have the following installed and/or configured:

* [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/)
* [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) and [subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-nav/how-to--sign-up-for-a-microsoft-azure-subscription)

Installation and setup of Terraform, and connection to Azure will be covered in the first lesson [Terraform Basics](./01%20-%20Terraform%20Basics/).

# Concepts of Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure resources, such as servers, networks, and databases, using code and automation scripts. Instead of configuring and managing infrastructure manually, IaC allows engineers to define their infrastructure requirements in code, which can be versioned, tested, and automated, resulting in more efficient, consistent, and scalable infrastructure operations. These concepts can be summarized as:

* **Automation:** IaC involves automating the provisioning, configuration, and management of infrastructure resources using code rather than manual processes.

* **Declarative Configuration:** IaC uses declarative language or scripts to define the desired state of the infrastructure. Engineers specify what the infrastructure should look like, and the IaC tool handles the implementation details.

* **Version Control:** IaC leverages version control systems like Git to manage and track changes to infrastructure code. This allows for collaboration, auditing, and easy rollback to previous configurations.

* **Immutable Infrastructure:** IaC promotes the concept of immutable infrastructure, where changes are made by creating entirely new instances rather than modifying existing ones. This enhances reliability and reproducibility.

## Benefits of Infrastructure as Code:

* **Scalability:** IaC enables the rapid scaling up or down of infrastructure resources to meet changing demands, reducing manual effort and potential errors.

* **Consistency:** Infrastructure configurations are consistent across all environments, reducing configuration drift and ensuring that development, testing, and production environments match.

* **Reproducibility:** IaC allows for the recreation of entire environments, ensuring consistency and reliability during deployment and recovery.

* **Versioning and Auditing:** Infrastructure code can be versioned, providing a history of changes and making it easier to track and audit configurations.

* **Collaboration:** Teams can collaborate effectively on infrastructure code using version control, improving communication and knowledge sharing.

## Challenges of Implementing Infrastructure as Code:

* **Learning Curve:** Implementing IaC may require a steep learning curve, especially for teams new to automation and coding practices. Choosing the right IaC tools and platforms can also be challenging, as there are multiple options available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

* **Complexity:** For very complex infrastructures, managing IaC code can become intricate and require careful design and planning.

* **Initial Setup Time:** Implementing IaC for existing infrastructures may require an initial time investment to migrate and automate existing configurations.

In summary, Infrastructure as Code offers significant advantages in terms of automation, consistency, scalability, and collaboration. However, it may also present challenges related to complexity, learning, and potential errors if not implemented carefully.

# Introduction to HashiCorp Terraform

[HashiCorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is a powerful open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that enables organizations to efficiently manage and provision their infrastructure in a **declarative** and **version-controlled** manner. With Terraform, you can define your infrastructure's configuration as code, making it easier to collaborate, automate, and scale your infrastructure deployments.

Terraform uses a simple, human-readable language to describe the desired state of your infrastructure, and it can manage resources across various cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more. By using Terraform, you can avoid manual and error-prone infrastructure provisioning processes and gain greater visibility and control over your IT resources.

This introductory course will explore the key concepts, benefits, and fundamental principles of Terraform. You'll have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience by working with Terraform to provision and manage infrastructure resources using [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-azure/), one of the leading cloud platforms in the industry. This practical approach will not only equip you with Terraform skills but also provide you with valuable experience using it within a real-world cloud environment.

Whether you're a developer, system admin, or DevOps engineer, Terraform can simplify your infrastructure management and deployment workflows, making it an invaluable tool in the world of modern cloud computing and infrastructure provisioning.
